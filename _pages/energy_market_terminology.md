In the context of wholesale prices, we need to understand the following:
VRE generators - variable renewable energy generators
SRMC - short-run marginal costs
- VRE generators may bid their available generation at their SRMC

Coal generators bid their minimum stable load (MSL) at negative prices (well, historically this happens).
