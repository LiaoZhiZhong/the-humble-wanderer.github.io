Is there a way to allocate a number to eat paragraph and sort them from highest to lowest like the IMDB rating?

## Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight Trilogy (10/10)

Absolutely amazing. Really captures the essence of love and banter.

## Everything, Everywhere, All at Once (9/10)

Great movie. Graphics resembles Doctor Strange in the way the multiverse interacts. Interesting concept on tackling family problems and the meaning of life (spoilers: treasure your loved ones and learn to appreciate the time you have with each other).
