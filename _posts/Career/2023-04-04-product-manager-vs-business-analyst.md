The product manager oversees maximizing the value of the product. As a result, the product manager determines the strategic and tactical direction, such as which characteristics to develop. Meanwhile, a business analyst frequently only provides data and recommendations to senior employees, and they include a cost-benefit analysis, a list of stakeholders, and various scenarios to consider. The choice would then be made by a manager, executive, panel, or the board.

The distinction between a product manager and a business analyst in terms of business criteria is that product managers oversee identifying the most practical challenges to tackle and guaranteeing that the crew is developing a comprehensive solution. Throughout the project, product managers ask "why" to discover the most suitable solution to assist the audience and market. On the other hand, business analysts are in charge of acquiring technical specifications to build the product. Business analysts are responsible for determining the "how" of a solution from the user's perspective. They inquire about internal business difficulties that may impose technical constraints on the project and possible remedies.
