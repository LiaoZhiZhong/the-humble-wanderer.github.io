Copied from [here](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-know-youre-a-mid-level-software-engineer-What-are-the-key-differences-from-junior-and-senior):

As a junior developer, you are capable of doing the technical coding tasks, 
but you require a great deal of direction. You might need to be told how to 
tackle a certain task, or you might need to be told some strategic approaches,
or you might need guidance on your team’s procedures and practices. You are 
contributing, but you aren’t contributing as much as the mid and senior level 
folks and you actually require a little of their time and energy to be as 
effective as possible.

As a mid-level developer, you are essentially autonomous. Your boss, team 
lead, project lead, etc. can say “Hey Scott, we need somebody to do this.” 
They hand you a spec and a timeline and you take off. You are contributing 
more than you used to as a junior developer and you are not sucking time away 
from other developers outside of occasional collaboration.

As a senior developer, your contributions are much larger. You are told “We 
have a problem, figure out how to solve it,” or “We have a major system that 
needs re-designing and re-implementation,” or “We have a crew of junior 
developers who need some guidance to make something happen” and you just go 
do it. You are now a major individual contributor or else you are contributing
through others. Maybe you are doing both.

If you find that you are able to undertake any task your team or boss asks of 
you with little or no guidance, you are likely a mid-level developer. If you 
are the one coming up with the tasks and/or helping ensure everyone else is 
able to perform their tasks, you are closer to senior.
