To see if a string contains a substring, you can use the `in` operator:
```python
if "blah" not in somestring:
    continue
```

Get good at working with lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples - the bread
and butter of default data structures in Python.

### Sets
`|=` is a set operator

### Inputs to functions
*args ← positional arguments

**kwargs ← keyword arguments
