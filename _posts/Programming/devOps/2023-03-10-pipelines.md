Jenkins is a devOps pipeline.

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your 
repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
[GitHub Actions use yaml file types to specify how to run the tests.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)
