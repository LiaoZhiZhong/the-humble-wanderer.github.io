Welcome to Melbourne! If it's your first time here and you're planning to reside
in Melbourne for a decent period of time, you'll probably need to set up the 
following things:
1. A place to rent and utility connections
2. Mobile sim card / data
3. Public transportation
4. Best places to get stuff like household items
5. Best places to get your groceries
6. Top places to visit
7. Best brunch places

Short version (to be revised later)

# A place to rent
You'll need to decide on:

1. What size i.e., studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc. Each of these has their
own associated pros and cons
2. Location relative to your workplace or university
3. Transportation options near your place

I usually rent 2 bedroom apartments because they're the most abundant and the
best price point. Studios and 1 bedroom apartments are pretty expensive ($400+)
per week (as of 2023), while 2 bedroom apartments are around $600-700 per week.
When split between 2 people, it's $300-350 per person.

I live in the suburbs so my 2 bedroom apartment is actually $415 per week. This
means it's quite cheap compared to living in the CBD.

If you can find a 3 bedroom or 4 bedroom apartment, you might be able to get
a better deal. However, keep in mind that it's a hassle to move to a different
apartment and the more people you live with, the more volatility you bring into
your life i.e., when one person leaves, you either find one more person to take
their place (a whole problem on it's own) or you all move out.

As a university student, you'll want to optimise for the best student life, 
networking (for job connections), and closest to restaurants, shopping centers,
etc so that you can explore things with friends as well as the convenience of
having things close by. 

For the best student life, you'll have to be close to your
campus so you can return home late at night without worrying about public 
transport but more importantly, your safety.

# Utility connections

Depending on where you live, you'll have different electricity and gas providers.
This is because you'll be on different electricity network providers e.g.,
PowerCor, AusNet, etc.

For internet, there are a few options but I personally used Aussie Broadband and
Belong. Belong is pretty stable but there are a few times during the year where
the internet connection dropped for an hour or two - it was pretty annoying.
Given that Aussie Broadband is only a bit more expensive, I'd recommend it for
it's reliability and customer service. Check out the reviews on reddit, you 
won't find anyone bashing on it.

# Mobile sim card / data
Get Kogan. It's the cheapest. I get the year plan that's around $100 for 100GB 
which I find is enough for me for the entire year (I barely use 30GB) but that's
also because I'm home most of the time (I work from home) so I just use the home
wifi. Kogan also has other mobile plans that are cheaper than Optus and Telstra plans.

# Public transportation
Get a myki card. Always tap on. The fine is too steep to risk not tapping.
It's $4.60 for the first 2 hours, another $4.60 for the next 2 hours, then 
free for every hour after that. In other words, it's capped at $9.20 per day.

# Best places to get stuff like household items
- Kmart
- Big W
- Kogan (shop online)
- Daiso
- Aldi
  - Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, laundry detergent, etc, are quite cheap here.

Never go to those random shops whose brands you don't recognise. Odds are that
the price is inflated and you can get the same thing for a much cheaper price
at kmart.

# Best places to get your groceries
- Aldi (almost everything is cheaper)
- Fresh food market (for veggies and fruits)
  - Queen Victoria Market (QVM)
  - Springvale Market
  - Don't go to Oakleigh market (too expensive)
  - Carnegie Market is alright but it's not as cheap as QVM or Springvale
- Woolies/Coles (for things that you don't have time to go to the markets for)

# Top places to visit
- I like hikes so I'd recommend:
  - Werribee Gorge hike 
  - Cathedral Ranges State Park (for the more advanced hikers)
  - Youyang regional park
  - Dandenong Ranges (1000 steps is pretty nice)

- It's nice to explore Geelong at least once. It's a nice little town with a
a lovely beach.

- If you're into art, you can visit the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV).

There's plenty of exploring to be done in the CBD:
- Melbourne Central
- Emporium
- State Library
- University of Melbourne campus
- Flinders Street Station (the walkway around Southbank)
- Federation Square
- Docklands

Mornington Peninsula is also a nice place to visit. It's a bit far from the city
but you can rent a car for a day and check it out. Philip Island is also a nice
place to visit - they have the Penguins Parade which is pretty neat.

To get a nice view of the city skyline, you can catch the Port Arlington ferry
from docklands with your bicycles (rent a few). The ferry is about an hour's ride.

If you've got more time, Wilson's Prom is a nice beach spot to take a look.
There are also a lot of hikes there. Unfortunately, it's about a 2-3 hour drive
from the CBD.

The Grampians is also a nice place to hike - the Pinnacle is quite breathtaking.

# Best brunch places
- Humble Rays (meh but it's alright)
- Brick Lane
