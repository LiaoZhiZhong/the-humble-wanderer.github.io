Welcome to Melbourne! If it's your first time here and you're planning to reside
in Melbourne for a decent period of time, you'll probably need to set up the 
following things:
1. A place to rent and utility connections
2. Mobile sim card / data
3. Public transportation
4. Best places to get stuff like household items
5. Best places to get your groceries
6. Top places to visit
7. Best brunch places

Short version (to be revised later)

# A place to rent and utility connections
You'll need to decide on:

1. What size i.e., studio, 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom, etc. Each of these has their
own associated pros and cons.
2. Location relative to your workplace or university

Home WiFi
- Aussie Broadband

# Mobile sim card / data
Get Kogan. It's the cheapest. I get the year plan that's around $100 for 100GB 
which I find is enough for me for the entire year (I barely use 30GB) but that's
also because I'm home most of the time (I work from home) so I just use the home
wifi.

# Public transportation
Get a myki card. Always tap on. The fine is too steep to risk not tapping.
