### So what happens if you use a [toll road without a valid account or pass?](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/road-network-and-performance/toll-roads-in-victoria/what-happens-if-you-dont-pay)

They'll send you an invoice because they know their car plate number (which is
linked to your vicroads account which has your postal address and email).

### Getting an account

From my experience with renting cars and riding in friends' cars, it seems that
everyone gets a `tag accounts` since it is the [cheapest way to travel on the freeway using tolls](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/road-network-and-performance/toll-roads-in-victoria/paying-tolls#:~:text=the%20toll%20roads.-,Tag%20accounts,-In%20most%20cases).

Open a prepaid account [here](https://www.linkt.com.au/accounts-and-passes/accounts/melbourne).
It's worth reading the [account fees](https://www.linkt.com.au/legal/fees/prepaid/melbourne#:~:text=Legal-,Prepaid%20Account%20Fees,-Amounts%2C%20Fees%20and).
