    - their estimated earnings is $333/week when driving for 10 hours.
        - Since fuel cost is around $50 for 130km, 10 hours would definitely cover 130km.
        - So net income is $283. Divide that by 10 is $28.30/hr
        - Then there's a vehicle inspection to register as an Uber driver. It's just not worth the hassle at the moment.
