After getting your car, you should probably get a dash-cam and a rear-cam. You 
can never be too sure with other drivers.

See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashcam/comments/xh1650/is_it_worth_getting_a_dash_cam/) 
for some pretty solid advice from reddit (but it's reddit so take it with
a grain of salt).
