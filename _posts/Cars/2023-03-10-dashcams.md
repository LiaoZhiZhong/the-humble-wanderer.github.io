After getting your car, you should probably get a front and back camera - you 
can never be too sure with other drivers.

See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashcam/comments/xh1650/is_it_worth_getting_a_dash_cam/) 
for some pretty solid advice from reddit (but it's reddit so take it with
a grain of salt). Good source of discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashcam/comments/rwnh9w/whats_the_best_front_and_rear_dash_cam_for_your/
) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/sr0opx/does_anyone_have_a_dashcam_which_one_is_good/
).

Advice from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashcams/comments/z4842h/recommendations_for_a_frontrear_facing_cams/)
, suggest that going for the cheapest dash cam that you can find on e.g., Amazon,
isn't the best idea. You want to make sure you go for something reliable, 
especially when accidents happen.

Note: Expected budget: $150 - $200+ for a single camera.

## Things to look for in a front and rear dash camera
- 170 degrees field of view for the front camera (can see 3 lanes)
- at least 120 degrees field of view for the rear camera 
- loop
- don't have batteries as it can die quickly when it gets hot inside cars parked in the sun - look for one with a super capacitor which will last much longer
- WDR so that the resolution is adjusted in all lighting conditions to get crisp images

## Typical brands
- VIOFO
- Thinkware
- BlackVue (bougie apparently)
- FineVu

for installing the hardware kit

## Attaching the dashcam
- Use the piping along the door to hide the wires - see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NGp4fmzdfo&ab_channel=THINKWAREDashCam%E2%84%A2).

A headliner is the material that covers the ceiling of a vehicle, but it does 
more than hide bare metal with color-coordinated soft fabric. Headliners 
provide insulation against heat and noise, and they can also hide wiring and 
hardware for electrical components, antennas and other accessories.
