After getting your car, you should probably get a dash-cam and a rear-cam. You 
can never be too sure with other drivers.

See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashcam/comments/xh1650/is_it_worth_getting_a_dash_cam/) 
for some pretty solid advice from reddit (but it's reddit so take it with
a grain of salt).
 
Things to look for in a front and rear dash camera
- 170 degrees field of view for the front camera (can see 3 lanes)
- at least 120 degrees field of view for the rear camera 
- loop
- don't have batteries as it can die quickly when it gets hot inside cars parked in the sun - look for one with a super capacitor which will last much longer
- WDR so that the resolution is adjusted in all lighting conditions to get crisp images

Typical brands are:
- VIOFO
- Thinkware
- BlackVue (bougie apparently)
- FineVu

Expected budget: $150 - $200+

We personally wouldn't recommend just going for the cheapest dash cam that you can find out there on Amazon. You want to make sure you go for something reliable, especially when accidents happen.
