Look for a car with around 200,000km mileage. More than 250,000km, you may be spending more money to fix things.

The lower the mileage, the more expensive.

For us, always consider a perfect balance between mileage and age. Both factors are equally important when properly calculated. But no matter how old or how long the car has been driven, one more important factor many buyers tend to overlook is how the car has been used and maintained by the previous owner.

When a car has been previously submerged in floodwater, or when it had been hit in a previous accident, no amount of repairs, good mileage or age could make up for the damage that had been done. To be sure with what you’re getting, get the vehicle identification number of the used car and check it with PPSR. Make sure that your car has not been written off or had not been involved in any physically damaging circumstances before. After all, it’s your investment you want to protect in the first place.

On average, a car should have around 10,000 miles per year. So, for an easy way to calculate how many miles on a used car is too much, just multiply its age by 10,000.
- 10,000 miles = 16,000 km

For example, if the car you're looking at was manufactured in 2010 with  only 60,000 miles on it, but was never regularly maintained with minimal service history, then it may not be a good deal.

Compare that to a vehicle that has 100,000 miles on the clock but is in great condition and has a full-service history with no real list of problems. That’s the better deal.

Looks like a good car:
