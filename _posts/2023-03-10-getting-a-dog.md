# TLDR:

I'm not a point in my life where I should get a dog because I like the freedom
to change my day however I see fit.

I thought it was worth putting down what chatGPT told me about the pros and cons
of getting a car.

## Pros of owning a dog as a single person:

Companionship: Dogs are known for their loyalty and companionship. They can provide you with a great sense of companionship, especially if you live alone.

Exercise: Dogs require regular exercise, which can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Taking your dog for walks or runs can be a great way to get some exercise and fresh air.

Socialization: Owning a dog can help you meet new people, particularly if you take your dog to the dog park or attend dog-friendly events in your community.

Stress relief: Petting and playing with a dog can be very calming and can help reduce stress and anxiety.

## Cons of owning a dog as a single person:

Responsibility: Owning a dog requires a significant amount of responsibility, including feeding, grooming, exercising, and providing medical care.

Time commitment: Dogs require a lot of time and attention, particularly if you have a high-energy breed. This can be challenging if you have a busy work schedule or travel frequently.

Expenses: Owning a dog can be expensive, particularly if you choose to adopt or purchase a purebred dog. You'll need to budget for food, toys, medical expenses, and potentially training or dog daycare services.

Limited freedom: Owning a dog can limit your freedom, particularly if you enjoy spontaneous travel or late nights out. You'll need to make sure that you have someone to care for your dog while you're away or plan ahead for dog-friendly travel options.
