# TLDR
From chatGPT's answer, it seems that there isn't much else to dips.

### Pulls up and chins up from chatGPT
Pull-ups are a great exercise for building upper body strength, particularly in the back and arms. There are different variations of pull-ups that can be done, and for beginners, it is important to start with the basic variations before moving on to more advanced ones. Here are the different types of pull-ups, listed in ascending order of difficulty for beginners:

1.  Assisted pull-ups: These are done using a machine or a resistance band to provide assistance in lifting the body weight. This variation allows beginners to build the necessary strength to perform unassisted pull-ups.
2.  Jumping pull-ups: In this variation, you jump up to the bar and then use your arms to pull your body up. This is a good way to build the necessary strength and coordination for performing full pull-ups.
3.  Negative pull-ups: This involves starting at the top of the pull-up position and slowly lowering yourself down. This variation allows beginners to focus on the lowering portion of the pull-up and build strength in the back and arms.
4.  Chin-ups: In this variation, the hands are placed closer together on the bar with palms facing towards the body. Chin-ups are generally easier for beginners compared to pull-ups because the biceps are more involved in the movement.
5.  Pull-ups: This is the classic variation, with hands placed shoulder-width apart on the bar and palms facing away from the body. Pull-ups are considered one of the most challenging upper body exercises and require a great deal of strength and control.

### Dips from chatGPT
Dips are a great exercise for building upper body strength, particularly in the chest, triceps, and shoulders. Similar to pull-ups, there are different variations of dips that can be done. Here are the different types of dips, listed in ascending order of difficulty for beginners:

1.  Bench dips: These are done using a bench, chair, or other elevated surface. You place your hands on the bench behind you, with your fingers pointing forward, and lower your body down by bending your arms. This variation is a good way to build the necessary strength to perform full dips.
2.  Assisted dips: These are done using a machine or a resistance band to provide assistance in lifting the body weight. This variation allows beginners to build the necessary strength to perform unassisted dips.
3.  Parallel bar dips: In this variation, you hold yourself up between two parallel bars and lower your body down by bending your arms. This is a more challenging variation because it requires more stability and strength than bench dips.
4.  Ring dips: In this variation, you hold onto two gymnastics rings and lower your body down by bending your arms. Ring dips are even more challenging than parallel bar dips because they require more stability and control.
5.  Weighted dips: This is the most advanced variation, where you add weight to your body using a weight belt or weighted vest. Weighted dips require a great deal of strength and control, and should only be attempted after mastering the other variations.

### Push up routine from chatGPT

Sure, here is a sample exercise routine that uses only variations of push-ups to target your chest, shoulders, and triceps:

1.  Warm-up: Start with a 5-10 minute warm-up of light cardio such as walking, jogging, or cycling.
2.  Standard push-ups: Do 3 sets of 10-15 standard push-ups with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Focus on proper form, keeping your body in a straight line and your elbows close to your body.
3.  Incline push-ups: Do 3 sets of 10-15 incline push-ups with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Place your hands on an elevated surface, like a bench or step, and perform the push-ups.
4.  Decline push-ups: Do 3 sets of 10-15 decline push-ups with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Place your feet on an elevated surface, like a bench or step, and perform the push-ups.
5.  Diamond push-ups: Do 3 sets of 10-15 diamond push-ups with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Place your hands close together, forming a diamond shape, and perform the push-ups.
6.  Wide-grip push-ups: Do 3 sets of 10-15 wide-grip push-ups with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Place your hands wider than shoulder-width apart and perform the push-ups.
7.  Plyometric push-ups: Do 3 sets of 8-12 plyometric push-ups with 1-2 minutes of rest between sets. Perform the push-up explosively, pushing yourself up so that your hands leave the ground, and then land softly.
8.  Cool-down: Finish with a 5-10 minute cool-down of light cardio or stretching.
    

Remember to focus on proper form and technique, and gradually increase the intensity as you progress.


### Airwalk pull up training program
If you want to build up to doing the Airwalk pull-up, it's important to first focus on developing the necessary strength and control through a structured training program. Here is a recommended training program that can help you build up to the Airwalk pull-up:

1.  Build foundational strength: Start with exercises that target the muscles needed for pull-ups, such as rows, chin-ups, and lat pulldowns. Work on building your strength gradually over time.
2.  Work on your grip strength: Your grip strength plays a crucial role in being able to perform pull-ups, so it's important to train your grip specifically. You can do this by performing exercises such as farmer's walks, dead hangs, and grip strengthener exercises.
3.  Practice hanging leg raises: The Airwalk pull-up requires you to lift your legs up towards the bar, so practicing hanging leg raises can help you develop the necessary core strength and control.
4.  Start with assisted pull-ups: Use resistance bands or a pull-up machine to assist you with your pull-ups as you work on building your strength.
5.  Practice negative pull-ups: Start at the top of the pull-up position and lower yourself down with control. This will help you build strength in the eccentric phase of the exercise.
6.  Work on explosive pull-ups: Practice explosive pull-ups to help you develop the power and explosiveness needed for the Airwalk pull-up.
7.  Gradually increase difficulty: Once you've developed sufficient strength and control with the above exercises, you can start practicing the Airwalk pull-up with a spotter or by using a lower bar to practice the movement with less resistance.

Remember, building up to the Airwalk pull-up takes time and dedication. Be patient, consistent, and focus on developing your strength gradually over time.

### How to do the airwalk pull up
The Airwalk pull-up is an advanced bodyweight exercise that requires a great deal of upper body strength and control. Here are the steps to perform an Airwalk pull-up:

1.  Find a horizontal bar that is high enough off the ground for you to hang from it with your arms fully extended.
2.  Hang from the bar with an overhand grip, with your palms facing away from your body and your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
3.  Pull yourself up towards the bar until your chin is over the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body.
4.  Once you reach the top of the pull-up, shift your weight forward and push your hips up towards the bar, while simultaneously straightening your arms.
5.  Keep your core tight and your body in a straight line as you perform the airwalk.
6.  Lower yourself back down to the starting position with control, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
    

Note: The Airwalk pull-up is an advanced exercise and should only be attempted 
by those who have already developed a significant amount of upper body strength 
and control. If you are not yet able to perform a standard pull-up, you should 
work on building your strength with easier exercises before attempting the 
Airwalk pull-up.
