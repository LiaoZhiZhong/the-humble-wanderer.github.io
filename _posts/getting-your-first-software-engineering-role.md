# How to get your first software engineering role

So you know your story/narrative and it has elements of “creating programs empowers me to create innovative solutions to complex problems” in it. The real world occupation is a software engineer for you and it’s many different flavors e.g., backend developer, frontend developer, devOps engineer, etc. The entry level job is literally a junior position in these fields. 

And you know where you want to apply i.e., big or small company.

To prepare yourself for this entry level job, you must first determine two things:

1. What stage are you at?
2. What’s your current skillset in this area?

What stage are you at?

- first year?
- second year?
- third year?
- maybe a fourth year?
- graduated and looking?

You’ll want to focus on different things at different stages.

What kind of portfolio do you have atm? The more useful question: what kind of skillset do you have and what’s your demonstrated proficiency in each language/aspect of the task?

- You’ll need to build up this demonstrated proficiency in your portfolio over time so the stage that you’re in determines what kind of growth you can afford to have
    - if you’ve graduated, you’re going to need to go all out and aim for a big project.
