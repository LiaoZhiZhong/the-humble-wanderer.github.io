On 28th July, I didn’t pass my driving test. This is despite having driven for more than 8 years.

Was I disappointed? yes. Was I going to let it get to me? No.

Some reflection is important so you don’t repeat the same mistakes but don’t let these emotions consume you. 

You are so much more than one result in your life. Your life is the accumulation of your actions, not each action.

To move on:

- find other things to do
- keep yourself occupied
- don’t think about it after you’ve processed it
    - counterintuitive in a way
    - so how do you process it and not cry?
