Only buy ingredients when the intention of cooking them on a certain day i.e., 
with the remaining ingredients in the fridge, I can actually plan how many 
meals they will serve then buy accordingly. With the way that I've been doing 
it, it's been quite wasteful.

[Cookies](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies) are the easiest things to bake so it's best to start off with that.

# Coffee
- A fresh press can be used to brew coffee. The difference between a coffee machine
and a french press is just that the french press is a manual process.
- The trick to removing the bitterness is to add more milk.
- Use full cream milk instead of soy milk. It'll taste much better.

- The gist of it is to repeatedly cook with more oil and let the layer build up naturally. Don't scrap off the black stuff cause that's the oil forming the layer.

What Are the Best Oils for High-Heat Cooking?
The best oils for standing up to high heat during frying are **avocado, peanut, canola, sunflower, and sesame oil**. These oils have a high smoke point (400°F and higher), which means they are better suited for cooking at higher temperatures. you'll need to use one of these oils for seasoning the wok.

[This is the wok I bought](https://londonwok.com/woks/carbon-steel-woks/)
- carbon steel is what the experts say is the best
- round bottom is the only way to go apparently haha, the flat bottom is to adapt to electric stoves but meh, we need the fire!
