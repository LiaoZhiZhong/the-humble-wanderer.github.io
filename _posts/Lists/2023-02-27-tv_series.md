## Amazing Stories

Season 1, episode 1 (8/10)

- amazing concept.

## Charmed

It's an okay tv series. More like something you'd watch in high school while you have quite a bit of time.

## Big Shot (Disney TV Series)

It's alright. I like the father daughter moments.

## Severance

## The Dropout
- Startup movie

## You are my glory
- I think the romance between the main leads is quite good. The tension and chemistry is well portrayed.

## Dash and Lily
- it's quite a charming tv series.
