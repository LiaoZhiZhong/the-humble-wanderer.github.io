# TLDR
Ended up going for [this armband](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B097ZR6DSY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A4XRJ8S0WXSO0&psc=1
).

Pretty thorough review on the [best phone holders](https://marathonhandbook.com/best-phone-holders-for-running/).

I wanted to get [this one](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B076QLD957?th=1&ref_=as_li_ss_tl&language=en_US&linkCode=gs2&linkId=3679d4decffbe73181a079d054e77e22&tag=marathonhandb-22
) but it didn't have my size.
