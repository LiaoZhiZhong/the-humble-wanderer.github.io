# TLDR

I went with the Jabra Elite 7 Pro Active but it kept falling out of my ears.
I would be able to jog with it but it felt uncomfortable. While I was using
it at home, I would have to keep adjusting it. Luckily, I was able to get a 
pair of AirPods which fit my ears much better so next time, don't get the ones
with the earbuds.

## Reason
- I want to jog more often
- I will probably listen to music more often as I jog

I looked into:
- [AirPods - $185](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/apple-airpods-with-charging-case-2nd-gen)
- [Jabra Elite 7 Pro - $179](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/jabra-elite-7-pro-anc-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-titanium-black)
- [Sony WF-1000XM4 - $389](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/sony-wf-1000xm4-truly-wireless-noise-cancelling-in-ear-headphones-black?queryID=24b6d121e4c4d01849c48887364cb12d&objectID=523089)
    - According to [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffXn0L6VYE&ab_channel=MikeO%27Brien), it is the best of 2022
- [Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 is good too apparently - $260](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/anker-direct-au-soundcore-by-anker-liberty-3-pro-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-midnight-black-42070698328284/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=product_listing_ads&gclid=CjwKCAiA2L-dBhACEiwAu8Q9YDPTQ_HzUnUtLb-FCgI-r5rwDjRFWwJ1z7YI6F6FNbYppJgtVeXL-xoCSQ4QAvD_BwE)
