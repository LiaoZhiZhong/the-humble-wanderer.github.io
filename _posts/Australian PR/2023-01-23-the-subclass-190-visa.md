## What is this visa

Essentially, it's a pathway to permanent residency where the state nominates you
for a permanent residency visa - [here's the website](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/skilled-nominated-190).

## Criteria and the process
<a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/skilled-nominated-190#Eligibility">
This</a> part of the website indicates all that you need to know about the criteria.

What this ultimately boils down to is:
1. Get a positive skill assessment from the assessing authority
2. Score a pretty decent score for the English exam (IELTS, PTE, etc)
3. Be under 45 years old

With these, you can apply for an [Expression of Interest (EOI)](https://skillselect.gov.au/SKILLSELECTSTS/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fSKILLSELECTSTS%2f%3fwa%3dwsignin1.0%26wtrealm%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fauth.dis.gov.au%252fadfs%252fservices%252ftrust%26wctx%3da6e893c0-a383-4435-92db-3105b4810e0d%26client-request-id%3defe743dd-acc0-4941-bd01-0080020400df&wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=http%3a%2f%2fauth.dis.gov.au%2fadfs%2fservices%2ftrust&wctx=a6e893c0-a383-4435-92db-3105b4810e0d&client-request-id=efe743dd-acc0-4941-bd01-0080020400df).

For the 190 visa, you don't need a positive EOI - you just apply for an EOI then
proceed to apply for a [Registration of Interest (ROI)](https://liveinmelbourne.vic.gov.au/contact-us/application-not-yet-started/which-visa-program-is-your-application-related-to/skilled-migration-visas/skilled-nomination-visa/skilled-pre-application/eoi-status-update).

When your ROI gets selected, Live in Melbourne will invite you to formally apply 
for a state nomination. From here, you upload your documents. It can take up to
12 weeks for them to reply.

After they accept your application, they will formally state that they will
nominate you for the 190 visa. At this point, your EOI will be accepted.

From here, you can apply for the 190 visa with the immigration department.

For reference, I applied for my EOI and ROI on the 25th February, 2023. I got my
ROI selected mid-March, 2023, then got my state nomination approved on the 
14th April, 2023.
