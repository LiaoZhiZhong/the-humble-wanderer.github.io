Use some sort of calendar to keep your life in check. I use google calendar.

## Chrome extensions
- newsfeed eradicator - removes newsfeed from facebook, instagram, youtube, etc
- google calendar - easy way to see how much time left till your next event 
- session buddy for copying all links to somewhere e.g., notion
- adblocker
- adblocker extension
- UV weather (just a fast way to get weather info)

## Notetaking apps
- [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes)
- Notion
- Write in markup in a github repo (your choice lol)
- Onenote

I've tried Evernote, Google Keeps, Google Docs, and Notes on the Mac. I don't
like them because:

- Evernote is too slow
- Google keeps lacks structure
- Google docs is a standalone document - no way to link to other documents
- Notes on the Mac doesn't have a good way to organise notes

Notion already syncs to an online database so you can use it among multiple devices.
For Obsidian, I'd recommend setting up a private github repository and 
backing it up there since a Vault is just a folder with some special files.

## Keyboard shortcuts on Chrome

- Ctrl + L - go to the search bar
- Ctrl + A - select everything
	- Then press Delete (don't even need to press Delete actually)
- Ctrl + T - new tab
- Ctrl + W - close tab
- Ctrl + Q - quit Chrome (this works for most if not all apps)
- `sheets.new` - to create a new google sheet linked to your gmail that's logged in
- `docs.new` - likewise but for google docs

## Keyboard shortcuts on Mac

- Use spotlight when you want to search for something (Cmd + Space)
- Use [rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) for moving and resizing windows 
in macOS using keyboard shortcuts or snap areas.
