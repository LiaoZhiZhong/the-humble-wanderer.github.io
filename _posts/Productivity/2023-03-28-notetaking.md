# Obsidian
If I need to learn more about Obsidian, I can start from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2z-7D4bQEA&ab_channel=LinkingYourThinking).

This youtuber `Linking Your Thinking` is pretty good at explaining the basics 
of Obsidian.

To toggle the checkbox status, use Windows key + Enter 
(customised via the hot keys section in the Obsidian settings).
