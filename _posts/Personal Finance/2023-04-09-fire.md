From this (youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A54VFBYfF9U&ab_channel=MarkTilbury):

1. Find your natural talents
	- find your game
		- see what you're good at
	- you should only be focusing on skills that you're naturally good at
2. Dedicate everything to your job
	- doing the bare minimum should never be celebrate
	- the way you do the small things is the way you'll do the big things
	- work to learn, not to earn
	- try to understand why things are the way they are in your company
3. Nurture your contacts and your image
	- If you don't have a good image, the people you want to connect with won't want to be your friend
4. Identify improvements and write them down
5. Test your fixes with a side hustle
	- what gets measured, gets managed
	- the people whose opinions matter the most are the ones who buy your product
6. Launch your business
