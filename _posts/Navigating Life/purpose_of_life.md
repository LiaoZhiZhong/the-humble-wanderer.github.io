As I write this on a quiet Sunday evening, I think to myself: how presumptuous am I to declare that I know what the purpose of life is.

I wanted to offer my 2 cents to those who are struggling with where to take their life. It’s often at the end of a chapter in one’s life where these kind of thoughts rises.

I think it’s to be happy. To try and fill your days being content that you may never find anyone, you can’t force anyone to be your friend, be a good person (do unto others what you’d like others to do to you - but expect nothing in return), learn to love yourself, learn to enjoy your quiet time (you may have a lot of it) and in doing so, you will avoid many of life’s unnecessary drama.

do what you love but if you don’t know yet, then do many things! Find friends that value you and treasure them. Find something worth doing that benefits the community too.
