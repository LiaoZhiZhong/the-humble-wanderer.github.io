From the youtuber Picking Nuggets, his video on [the 4 biggest traps in life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bL5JHKf16k&ab_channel=PickingNuggets)
lists:
1. Working for (material) things as rewards. A tweet from
Naval Ravikant sums it up well:
`People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people
busy upgrading their lifestyles can't fathom.`

Ignore your peers. Recommend to read "Mimetic desire". This was life changing 
for Peter Thiel.
`It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.` by Warren Buffett.

2. "That's easy for you (someone already wealthy) to say"
It is hard to become wealthy, but that's also the rewarding thing.
`Your real resume is just a catalogue of all your suffering`
`You have to do hard things anyway to create your own meaning in life`
`One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you
as the most beautiful` - Sigmund Freud

3. The Victim Mentality
`Happiness is a choice`

4. The Competition Trap


Retirement is "when you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow.
When today is complete in and of itself."
- You can do this by having passive income and living a frugal life style.
- Zero costs (become a monk)
- Your work is your passion

on Joe Rogan's podcast with Naval Ravikant is not related to this post but it's 
worth watching slowly and digesting the content.
