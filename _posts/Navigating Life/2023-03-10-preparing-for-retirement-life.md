I came across this in my personal notes and thought it was pretty interesting.
I took notes from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0WZfxmEMyA&ab_channel=ThisIsOurRetirement ). 

- you need to be aware of declining health as you age.
- After 65, every year after that feels like 5 years from when you’re 50. 
  In other words, when you turn 55, you feel X amount worse. 
  When you’re 66 years old, you feel X amount worse from 65.
- If you have a partner, you have to be aware of when each of you retire. 
  You want to retire around the same time so that you BOTH have your health 
  intact so you can do the things you’ve always wanted e.g., travelling.
