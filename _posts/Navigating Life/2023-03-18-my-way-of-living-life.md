No one can tell you how to live your life yet as humans, we can't help but ask
others how they choose to live their lives, so we can "optimise" ours, to live
a life we won't regret.

But you see, that's the secret - what you regret is up to you. I personally
believe there are common factors that most people are agree on that would lead
to a life full of regret. For instance, exercise is good for you. If you decide
to live a life with no exercise and you're on your death bed at the age of 35,
you'd probably regret not exercising more regularly.

Gathering more data on what these common factors are can serve as a great 
foundation for making decisions in our everyday lives.

I personally believe that one should no smoke, especially since I grew up with
a mild case of asthma. I imagine all the late nights where my parents took care
of me while I was struggling to breathe. I doubted whether I would ever get 
better, whether I would make it that night - I'm sure my parents had their fair
share of scares too. As such, I feel very strongly about inhaling any harmful
gases.

But I can't enforce this belief on anyone - it is your choice whether you wish
to smoke or not. In fact, my sharing of this story adds more data to your 
"don't stop" list thereby creating bias in your database.

So now that you're aware that biases exist depending on where you get your data
from, what can you do about it? After all, you still need to collect data - 
you've yet to figure out how you want to live life.
