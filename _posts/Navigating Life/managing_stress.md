How to manage your stress levels

- knowing which bad habits you have, the amount of time you need to adjust
- learning to accept that you’ll need time to adjust (pick a realistic timeframe)
- don’t just push forward with anxiety everyday - still do the things you enjoy
    - counterproductive in reducing stress!

### Summary

### My Philosophy in Life

My philosophy in life is that everyone should strive towards a dream that brings them happiness whilst understanding that there are tried and tested sources of happiness that we should work towards as well. These are:

- getting good exercise as a healthy body will enable you to live a higher quality of life
- investing in friends that also invests in you
    - sharing good times and bad times with friends deepen your relationship such that you’re able to depend on each other and know that you’re not quite as alone in the world as you might have thought you were
- living with a partner
    - need I say more?
- maintaining good relationships with your parents and immediate family members
    - they were there since day 1. You should continue to spend time with them.

### What does this have to do with stress?

Depending on our circumstances, we not be able to choose what stress to go through. For instance, if you’re from a low socio-economic background, there’s a lot of barriers to overcome to live a decent life. You may need to work 6 hours a day on top of studying 40 hours a week at university in addition to commuting 2 hours to and from home. 

However, I’d like to direct my attention to my audience who are in the position where they can choose what they want to do with their life and what stress you want to go through.

### Understand the causes of stress for you

Stress usually arises from an uncomfortable situation where you’re tasked with something that you don’t know how to complete it. There are other forms of stress but this is the one I’d like to focus on in particular, the work stress that is stretched out over a long horizon for example, working as a doctor.

Doctors are notorious for their long work hours and intense duties. It is then no surprise that medical school and their residency really puts the students to the test in terms of their mental fortitude and lifestyle habits. 

Medical students are forced to make the decision everyday to commit to a certain routine so that they can not only survive but thrive in their lifestyle. By committing to this routine, their “stress” disappears. In other words, the situation is no longer uncomfortable to them.

So the first step in managing your stress levels is to understand that you’ll want to tune your routine/lifestyle habits such that after 66 days (the duration at which a habit sinks in) and to do so, you need to tell yourself everyday for the next 66 days that this new routine/habit is worth the hassle. In order to convince yourself of this, the cause of stress must be meaningful to you.
